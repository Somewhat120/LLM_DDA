The drug is eliminated through feces predominantly as unchanged drug along with minor renal excretion of metabolites. Toxicity of ponatinib includes cardiotoxicity, such as heart failure, and vascular occlusive events, which may be attributed to its inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors. Ponatinib targets a broad spectrum of tyrosine kinases, particularly BCR-ABL, the causative mutant protein in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and T315I-mutated forms which are resistant to first-generation inhibitors. The drug is indicated for the treatment of CML and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) resistant or intolerant to prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Significant side effects include arterial occlusion, hepatotoxicity, hypertension, and pancreatitis. Clinically, ponatinib is utilized in cases where other treatments have failed or are not suitable, representing a critical option in drug-resistant leukemia, and its judicious use is informed by balancing its clinical benefits against the risks of serious adverse events."
Fluticasone furoate,DB08906,"Fluticasone furoate, with DrugBank ID 'DB08906', is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with a detailed chemical structure characterized by the presence of a fluoro group at the 17 position, a furoate moiety at the 21 position, and a thiazolidine ring fused to the prednisolone backbone. Chemically, it falls into the category of corticosteroids, and the chemical scaffold is based on a pregnane structure, similar to other corticosteroids like fluticasone propionate and mometasone furoate. In terms of pharmacokinetics, fluticasone furoate is well-absorbed following intranasal administration, but it has low systemic bioavailability due to extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver, where it is metabolized primarily by cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4 to inactive metabolites, followed by excretion mainly in the feces and, to a lesser extent, in urine. The risk of systemic toxicity is low, but when it occurs, it can involve corticosteroid side effects such as adrenal suppression and growth retardation. Fluticasone furoate exerts its effects by binding to the glucocorticoid receptor, a nuclear hormone receptor that modulates the transcription of various genes involved in inflammatory and immune responses. It is primarily indicated for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, including hay fever and perennial rhinitis, and as maintenance therapy of asthma. Common side effects include epistaxis (nosebleeds), nasal irritation, and headache, though it generally has a favorable safety profile when used as directed. Clinically, fluticasone furoate is used both as a monotherapy and in combination with other drugs such as vilanterol (as in the medication Breo Ellipta) for managing asthma symptoms and improving lung function in patients with a history of exacerbated respiratory conditions."
Canagliflozin,DB08907,"Canagliflozin, associated with DrugBank ID DB08907, is a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor characterized by a complex chemical structure comprised of a C-glycoside with a glucose moiety bound to a substituted phenyl ring through a spiroketal linkage. Belonging to the chemical category of gliflozins, it shares a similar C-gliflozin scaffold with comparable drugs such as dapagliflozin and empagliflozin. A key feature of canagliflozin's pharmacokinetics is its high oral bioavailability and its preferential renal excretion. Once absorbed, it exhibits a plasma protein binding rate of approximately 99% and is predominantly metabolized by O-glucuronidation, primarily by UGT1A9, followed by partial metabolism through CYP3A4. Canagliflozin has a half-life conducive to once-daily dosing and is excreted in feces and urine. Concerning toxicity, canagliflozin has been associated with adverse effects such as increased risk of genital mycotic infections, urinary tract infections, and potential hypotensive episodes, especially in volume-depleted individuals. Its primary target proteins are the SGLT2 receptors located in the proximal renal tubules. The drug is indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus as it lowers renal glucose reabsorption and induces glycosuria, thereby reducing blood glucose levels. Side effects can include genitourinary infections, hyperkalemia, and a small risk of increased limb amputations. Clinically, canagliflozin has been used both as a monotherapy and in combination with other diabetic medications such as metformin or insulin to improve glycemic control in adult patients with type 2 diabetes, positively impacting both HbA1c levels and body weight. Thus, its role as an antidiabetic agent is significant, offering an alternative mechanism of action conducive to a multifaceted approach to diabetes management."
