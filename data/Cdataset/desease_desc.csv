gilbert syndrome,D143500,"Gilbert Syndrome, denoted in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database under ID 'D143500', is a hereditary condition characterized by mild, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Central to its pathogenesis are mutations in the UGT1A1 gene, which encodes the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1, pivotal for the hepatic conjugation of bilirubin. Notably, the most common mutation associated with Gilbert Syndrome is a homozygous polymorphism in the TATAA box of the UGT1A1 promoter, commonly referred to as UGT1A1*28. This mutation leads to reduced expression of the UGT1A1 enzyme, thereby impairing bilirubin conjugation and excretion.

Gilbert Syndrome typically follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, underscoring the genetic component of this disease. Despite its genetic underpinnings, it is usually benign, manifesting clinically with mild jaundice, especially during periods of stress, fasting, or illness, without significant liver damage or dysfunction.
