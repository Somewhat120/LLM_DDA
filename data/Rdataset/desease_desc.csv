These genetic alterations disrupt normal hematopoiesis and are critical in the activation of several signaling pathways, notably the PI3K/AKT, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and survival. Treatment modalities commonly involve tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g., Imatinib for cases without the D816V KIT mutation), corticosteroids to manage inflammation, and chemotherapy agents like Cladribine. Patients may experience comorbidities such as anaphylaxis and peptic ulcer disease due to abnormal mediator release by mast cells. This disease inherently varies from indolent to aggressive forms, manifesting clinically with symptoms ranging from skin lesions (urticaria), to anaphylaxis, to organomegaly. Diagnostic criteria include the presence of multifocal dense infiltrates of mast cells in bone marrow biopsies and elevated serum tryptase levels. Genetic testing for the aforementioned mutations provides a clear diagnosis and helps in guiding treatment options. Leukemia, Mast-Cell can be inherited in a sporadic manner with some familial cases suggesting a genetic predisposition, although specific inheritance patterns are not fully established. This complex disease thus requires a multidisciplinary approach for diagnosis, typified by genetic, histologic, and biochemical testing alongside clinical evaluations to manage and mitigate its diverse clinical manifestations."
